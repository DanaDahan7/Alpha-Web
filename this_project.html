                    <p>
                        In this academic project, I've closely examined Alpha-Mix, a machine learning method. The aim
                        was to assess how well Alpha-Mix performs under various conditions. I explored different
                        scenarios by altering the amount of labeled data, using 10,000 and 50,000 labeled samples, and
                        tried it with various deep learning models like MLP, ResNet, and Vision-Transformers. Diverse
                        datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR100, and CIFAR10, were also part of the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        In order to test the performance of Alpha-Mix, I implemented the model based on the article with
                        the help of the <a class="alpha_git"
                            href="https://github.com/aminparvaneh/alpha_mix_active_learning">article's repository on
                            GitHub</a>. First I encountered a number of bugs from the

                        Alpha-Mix repository, I fixed the bugs and created a fork that I used throughout the project,
                        <a class="myfork_alpha" href="https://github.com/DanaDahan7/alpha_mix_active_learning">My fork
                            for Alpha Mix</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the project, I conducted a series of tests on Alpha-Mix using different datasets and
                        models. The objective was to determine when Alpha-Mix outperforms traditional methods and when
                        there's little difference compared to randomly selecting data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's the key distinction: Alpha-Mix intelligently selects which data to label by considering
                        both labeled and unlabeled samples, looking for inconsistencies in predictions. In contrast,
                        random sampling adds data without any specific rules. I updated the labeled data in both cases,
                        but with Alpha-Mix, I followed a specific method for data selection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After each update, such as training the model with 10% of the data and then with 20% of the
                        data, I measured the model's performance. This allowed me to compare Alpha-Mix with random
                        sampling and understand when Alpha-Mix proves more effective. I conducted these analyses using
                        different models, datasets, and various amounts of training data to gain a comprehensive
                        understanding of Alpha-Mix's strengths and limitations.<br>
                        In particular, I trained and tested the following models:

                            id="models-table-img">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In the preliminary review of the research, I recommend going through the order of the tabs in
                        the navigation bar.
