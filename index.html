                        ALFA-Mix introduces a novel approach to Batch Active Learning (AL) within the domain of machine
                        learning, as detailed in the article <a class="parvaneh"
                            href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Parvaneh_Active_Learning_by_Feature_Mixing_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf">"Active
                            Learning by Feature Mixing"</a> Active learning
                        represents a distinct facet of machine learning, wherein a learning algorithm engages in
                        interactive exchanges with a user or labeler, seeking guidance for labeling samples that pose
                        uncertainties, for example those residing near decision boundaries.
                    </p>
                    <p> Alpha-Mix, as proposed in the paper, emerges as an innovative AL methodology. It begins by
                        selecting a subset from the labeled dataset known as "anchors." These anchors are strategically
                        chosen to encapsulate the most common features for each class, achieving a minimal yet highly
                        effective representation of different classifications. Subsequently, for each unlabeled sample,
                        a process of interpolation with each anchor sample is carried out to assign labels. Any
                        unlabeled sample that results in inconsistent predictions, even once, is earmarked for inclusion
                        in a "candidate set."</p>
                    <p>
                        Following this initial phase, the candidate set undergoes a clustering process, wherein
                        centroids are identified within each cluster. These centroid samples are then presented to a
                        human user for the purpose of labeling. This method essentially involves exploring the
                        contextual characteristics of unlabeled samples by combining them with information from
                        previously labeled data. The interpolated data helps identify instances of conflicting
                        predictions and sheds light on features that elude the model's grasp within unlabeled samples.
                    </p>
                    <p> The underlying motivation behind this method lies in its quest to identify and actively
                        assimilate novel features in real-time, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability and learning
                        capabilities.</p>
